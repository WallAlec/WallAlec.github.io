# [Project 1: Classifier: Distinction between Orality and Literacy](https://github.com/WallAlec/Orality_vs_Literacy_in_dialouge/blob/main/OralityVsLiteracy-main/main.ipynb)
* Created a tool that is able to distinquish between Orality and Literacy. 
* Read in 100s of books as well as transcripted speech texts. 
* Was able to see the relationship between written and oral dialogue.

# [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
