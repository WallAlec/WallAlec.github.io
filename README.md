# [Project 1: Classifier: Distinction between Orality and Literacy](https://github.com/WallAlec/Orality_vs_Literacy_in_dialouge/blob/main/OralityVsLiteracy-main/main.ipynb)
* Created a tool that is able to distinquish between Orality (spoken) and Literacy (written) language. 
* Read in 100s of books as well as transcripted speech texts. 
* Was able to see the relationship between written and oral dialogue.

# Project 2: SuperComputer Center LiDAR
For this project I worked with a team running the National Science Foundation's Open Topography Facility that distributes high resolution topography datasets and associated processing tools to the earth science community via a web-based portal interface. Looked at hyperspectral and LIDAR data from remote sensing equipment. Was able to interpret data in PostgreSQL, pgadmin and MySQL on a daily basis to eventually create visualizations. Due to the private nature of the data from the clients, I am unable to attach private repositories and elected to share general user trends in my analysis. Anonomized for public viewing here:
