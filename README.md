## Alec Wall - Data Science Engineer


### About me:

I am a believer in data and logic. I am able to thrive with my good friends Python and SQL. I am a rising senior at UC Berkeley, studying data science and with focus on computation and software development. I am looking to expand my abilities by gaining experience with finance focused datasets. I enjoy looking at complex problems and crafting a detailed solution. I feel accountable for the things that I do. I feel a sense of urgency in making sure a job is well done. I want to be in a team where I am there to serve my team and they are there for me.
